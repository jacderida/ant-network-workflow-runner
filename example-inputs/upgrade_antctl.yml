# Inputs for running the `Upgrade Node Manager` workflow.
# This workflow uses the `testnet-deploy upgrade-node-manager` command to upgrade the node manager
# to a specified version.

# Required
network-name: DEV-02
# The version of `safenode-manager` to upgrade to.
version: 0.11.2

# Optional
# Remove any you don't want to use.

# Run the command only against certain types of nodes. Valid values are `boostrap`,`generic`,
# `genesis`, or `private`.
# The `custom-inventory` input takes precedence over this input.
# If you want to run against all nodes, remove this input.
node-type: generic
# Run only against certain nodes within the inventory.
# If this input is used, the `node-type` input will be ignored.
# If you want to run against all nodes, remove this input.
custom-inventory:
  - DEV-02-node-1
  - DEV-02-node-2
# Use these inputs if you want some custom version of `testnet-deploy` to be
# used in the run. It can either be a branch on a fork, or a specific version.
# If you want to use a branch, both the `testnet-deploy-branch` and
# `testnet-deploy-repo-owner` inputs are required.  The vast majority of the
# time, you will just want to use the latest version of `testnet-deploy`, and so
# these inputs can be removed.
testnet-deploy-branch: experimental-feature
testnet-deploy-repo-owner: maidsafe
testnet-deploy-version: 0.1.0
