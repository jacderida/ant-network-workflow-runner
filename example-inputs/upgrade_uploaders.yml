# Inputs for running the `Upgrade Clients` workflow.
# This workflow upgrades the autonomi version on the client vms.

# Required
network-name: DEV-02
# The version of `autonomi` to upgrade to.
version: 0.1.5

# Optional
# Remove any you don't want to use.

# Use these inputs if you want some custom version of `testnet-deploy` to be
# used in the run. It can either be a branch on a fork, or a specific version.
# If you want to use a branch, both the `testnet-deploy-branch` and
# `testnet-deploy-repo-owner` inputs are required. The vast majority of the
# time, you will just want to use the latest version of `testnet-deploy`, and so
# these inputs can be removed.
