# Inputs for running the `Stop Nodes` workflow.
# This workflow uses the node manager `stop` command to stop nodes on any machines that Ansible will
# run against.

# Required
network-name: DEV-02

# Optional
# Remove any you don't want to use.

# Forks can be set to 1 to force Ansible to run against one machine at a time. This allows a
# controlled stop against several machines. Otherwise, forks will default to 50.
ansible-forks: 1
# Applies a delay before issuing the stop command. This is useful if one node is running on each
# machine. Without it, Ansible would just stop the node and immediately move to the next machine
# Units are in seconds.
delay: 30
# Run only against certain nodes within the inventory.
# If this input is used, the `node-type` input will be ignored.
custom-inventory:
  - DEV-02-node-1
  - DEV-02-node-2
# Applies an interval between each node being stopped. To slowly stop nodes over several machines,
# set `ansible-forks` to 1 and then apply a large value here, like one or two minutes. Units are
# in milliseconds.
interval: 60000
# Run the command only against certain types of nodes. Valid values are `boostrap`,`generic`,
# `genesis`, or `private`.
# The `custom-inventory` input takes precedence over this input.
node-type: bootstrap
# Use these inputs if you want some custom version of `testnet-deploy` to be
# used in the run. It can either be a branch on a fork, or a specific version.
# If you want to use a branch, both the `testnet-deploy-branch` and
# `testnet-deploy-repo-owner` inputs are required.  The vast majority of the
# time, you will just want to use the latest version of `testnet-deploy`, and so
# these inputs can be removed.
testnet-deploy-branch: experimental-feature
testnet-deploy-repo-owner: maidsafe
testnet-deploy-version: 0.1.0
